    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To listen to others perform the presentations they have made. Learn from other's mistakes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? (add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes and no. Yes, as other peoples, and no because I didnâ€™t perform it myself.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I listened to others perform their speech and understood that most of them had shown lots of good effort and work been put in but they did not answer the question. In the end it got frustrating.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I talked about things to do with cyphers rather than the similarities between different cyphers. Consequently, this limited my learning. I talked about what a cypher actually is and examples of them. I also talked about the perfect cypher but as I said earlier, this was the wrong thing to talk about. I now need to change this for next week or I will be in trouble!!!</td>
