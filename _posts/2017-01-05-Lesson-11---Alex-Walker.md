    <td>I learnt by listening to Mr Keen about how we were not putting enough effort into our latest work. He told us that we need to focus more on what he says as many of us didn't post the homework on time. He also referred to his old jobs of sucking up spoons for 12 hours, the type of job that required no effort. Most of the lesson however was us listening to him about how idiotic Mc Donald workers are and how that is what we are going to become if we dont buck our ideas up.</td>
