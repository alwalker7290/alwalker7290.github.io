<table><td><p>In my Computing lesson on Friday, 30th September, I know time flies especially if your having fun, we were trying to use basic techniques on Google Sheets because Google Sheets is a handy tool and it can be used for everything. In my case I used Google Sheets as a shop. I sold:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Footballs</li>
  <li>Rugby Balls</li>
  <li>Hockey Balls</li>
  <li>Cricket Balls</li>
</ul>
<p> I sold each for very unique prices. But mine was cheap compared to Joss, who was sat next to me, selling planets for millions of pounds and also selling the domination of the world</p>
<p> Incase you were wondering at first my Google Sheet looked like this...</p></td></table>
