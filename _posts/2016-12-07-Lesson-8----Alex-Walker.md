    <td>We started off with a bit of confusion over our teacher. In the end we swapped Mr Tansley for Mr Keen. We listened to Mr Keen go over his expectations again and then we got on with reading the information off the board. We then went through what we read and understood the likes of the enigma machine in more detail. </td>

    <td>We missed the first Â¼ of an hour trying to find out which teacher we had. The fact that we had a new teacher also slowed things down a bit as we wanted to get to know each other.</td>
