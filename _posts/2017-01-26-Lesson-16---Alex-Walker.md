    <td>We learnt about ASCII which is a conversion and a number chart. We didn't know what ASCII was and our first task was to look up what ASCII was and find out how it is related to binary. ASCII converts between binary, symbols and denary. This is used a lot by many computers. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.</td>
