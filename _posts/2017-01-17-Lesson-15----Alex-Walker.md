    <td>I listened to my classmate's solutions and put it into practice. Mr Keen set us a task which took us about 15 minutes. He explained and completed it in under 5. It was really interesting to understand the easy patterns between Binary, Hexadecimal and Decimal.

I also helped Harry because he wasn’t in the lesson.

At home I have been practicing by writing random numbers and trying to convert them into the other bases.</td>
