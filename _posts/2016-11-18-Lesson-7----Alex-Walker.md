    <td>Today, I listened to Mr Keen and Mr Tansley. We went through others blogs. Some were absolutely brilliant and others were highly pathetic. We looked at their aesthetic values and how much effort had been put into it. We discussed whether it looked professional, and also we looked at the colour scheme.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>This time I thought about things myself but I did get a bit distracted and I lost track of time because all I.T lessons go so quicklyâ€¦ Also I would prefer if we had time to transfer it onto our blogs.</td>

    <td>I will add lots more different factors to my spreadsheet and make the blog look nicer. I will change the background as well.</td>
