    <td>We went through each other's' presentations and evaluated them however the first 3 or 4 didn’t answer the question of the similarities of ciphers. However Peter’s and Josh’s presentations were 'very good’ and they were the standard set. All of us except them two had to improve our presentations for homework.</td>
