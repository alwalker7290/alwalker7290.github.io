    <td>Today Mr Tansley taught us more about future jobs and how only normal people use spreadsheets for their money. He taught us how to put shadow borders around certain objects in styles.scss. I listened to Mr Tansley and I also used W3Schools website and that gave me the answer that I needed. Also I found some good ideas on other people's Github pages so I right clicked, clicked view page source and transferred their code into my blog. It was a bit of cheating but I used my 'computational thinking.â€™</td>
