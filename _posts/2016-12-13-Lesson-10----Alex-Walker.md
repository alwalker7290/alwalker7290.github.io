    <td>Today's lesson was more of a theory lesson than a computing lesson. Mr Keen talked about the importance of effort and commitment. My favourite analogy that he taught us was this question… What is the difference between a D and an A*? 

The answer is CBA. The grading system goes  D, C, B, A and A* (or at least it used to) but the term CBA also stands for Can’t Be Asked. 

Mr Keen spoke to us about how every piece of work we produce is a statement saying, "This is me!" It was a very intriguing lesson. </td>

    <td>I would like to do some more written or more interactive work as I think it helps keep things in my head. However I am unsure that it would have been necessary for this lesson. </td>
