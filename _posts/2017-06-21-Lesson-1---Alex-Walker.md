(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes I did but I did not complete the whole brief as the code doesn't look through a list of words to see if it's correct.</td>

    <td>Over the last week Mr Keen has taught us how to problem solve in Python. I used techniques in the lesson such as starting it out by writing bullet points of what I have to complete. I also tried using other techniques like asking people and searching on the internet how to use certain commands.</td>
