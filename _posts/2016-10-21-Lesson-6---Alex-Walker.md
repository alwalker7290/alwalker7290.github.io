    <td>We did the same thing as last week today except this week I was more focused on making my Google Sheet look epic than making my blog look appeasing. I listened to Mr Tansley talk about his life and how he uses sheets for his money and also about how he is a beginner like us. Although he is probably more passionate about this then all of us put together. </td>
