    <td>Today, I listened to Mr Keen We went through other's presentations. Two were absolutely brilliant and others were highly pathetic. We looked at how each presentation answered the question and even after two weeks to understand the concept over half of us still hadn’t answered the questions of the similarities.</td>

    <td>This time I thought about things myself but I did get a bit distracted and I lost track of time because all I.T lessons go so quickly… Also I would prefer if we had time to transfer it onto our blogs, and amend our presentations.</td>
